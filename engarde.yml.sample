  # By default, engarde sends packets through all the available network interfaces.
  # You will probably need to exclude some interfaces (Bluetooth or virtual ones, for example).
  # Lauch "engarde-client list-interfaces" to show all the detected interfaces, and form your own list based on that.
  # If you don't need to exclude any interface, you can omit this or just write `excludedInterfaces: []`

    - "Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1"
  # Sometimes, over specific network interfaces, it's useful to reach the server through another IP address.
  # This is the case if there are two totally separated networks between the client and the server, with different IP addresses.
  # You can specify an array of maps where you specify the network interface name and the destination address to use for this interface.
